  * correct an error in the manual.


Version 1.4.3 (Dec 5, 2007):

* Added support for MPFR. This is a extended precision library based
  on GMP, but with correct rounding. It includes functions like sin,
  cos, exp, log, etc.
* Added some fixes for the library QD.
* Internal changes so that the time-stepper propagates a bit less of
  roundoff error.
