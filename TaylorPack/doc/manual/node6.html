Once the input file is ready, there are two main steps in the
construction of the Taylor integrator.
<P>
First, we should ask <B>taylor</B> to produce the code to compute the
jet of derivatives and the automatic step size (and degree)
control. This code is arithmetic-independent, in the sense that the
real numbers are declared as <TT>MY_FLOAT</TT> (type to be defined
later) and the arithmetic operations have been replaced by C
macros. Hence, the selection of basic arithmetic only depends on the
definition of these macros.
<P>
The second step is to ask <B>taylor</B> to produce a header file with a
concrete definition of the type <TT>MY_FLOAT</TT> and the macros that
define the basic arithmetic. This file is included by the previous C
file with the jet of derivatives and the step size control, so that
the C preprocessor can substitute these macros by the code for
the desired arithmetic.
<P>
We provide header files to use
some extended precision arithmetics (later we give a concrete list),
but none of these libraries is included in the <B>taylor</B> package;
the user is supposed to retrieve and install them separately.
<P>
To use an arithmetic different from the ones mentioned here, the user
only needs to introduce the corresponding function calls in the header
file.
<P>
The two previous steps can be combined in a single one, by asking <B>
taylor</B> to put everything (jet, step size and headers) in a single
file.
<P>
The next section contains a simple example, using the standard
double precision of the computer. Next, in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#secclo">5.2</A>, we
will show all the options of the <B>taylor</B> program.
