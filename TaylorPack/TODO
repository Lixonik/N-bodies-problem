Angel,

  I'm looking at your new step.c now. 
  I noticed that you have included a constant
#define ND 6 /* dimension of phase space */
  and has excluded the parameter 'nd' from the routine
taylor_step_NAME

  Question:

    Does this limit the system to dimension 6? If yes,
    I suggest we put the parameter 'nd' back.

This makes it can work as a filter. One can use
 taylor < input > output
or some such. I find it useful. I'll make it 
print some help message out to stderr.

I'll add two options
  -uss, -userstepsize
  -ussname, -userstepsizename
